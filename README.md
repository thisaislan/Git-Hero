# Git Hero
Every time I see a git tree I think it would be cool if I could play guitar hero with it. So I decided to create my own guitar (or bass) hero with a git tree.

## How it works
You just need a repo link ended in .git

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thisaislan/git-hero/main/images/how_it_works_1.png"/></div>

Past the link on the first screen of the game

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thisaislan/git-hero/main/images/how_it_works_2.png"/></div>

The game will use the information of commits and branches to create musical notes to play, and you can just play Git Hero now! :guitar:

## Prerequisites
You will need `Unity`, I used `2020.1.2f` to make this project, `git` installed and `Terminal`, if you're a Mac user, or `PowerShell`, if you're a Windows user.

## There is something serious about this project
No and yes... Actually that project is just a proof of concept, the idea behind, as you already know, is just use git tree as notes on a guitar hero based game.
However, if we remove the game part and the background music, that project can create specific sound from any git project, in that case we can create a type of audio metric to git projects, that can check its health, integrity and other status we need to know.
Of course in order to create that kind of audio analysis we first need to create new rules to represent better git nuances, such as checkout, rebase, merges and others.
Ok, ok, now you may think, why will we do that? Simple, to have one more way to complement a project health analysis, in the same way we have a visual analysis system, we can create audio analysis systems. I know, it may sound like a crazy idea, but every concept is a little crazy on its start.


## Something else
I would like to say that this kind of audio system to git analysis will help people with some kind of visual difficulties. But I really don't know. In that case I hope so, and I hope that project will help us think about git, including people and analysis systems in another way. And, no less important, I hope you enjoy the game :slightly_smiling_face:

## Thanks
